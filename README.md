# Hydropower energy modeling tool

Hydropower System Performance and Financial Analysis Modeling script 
============================================================

This script performs a comprehensive analysis of a hydropower system, calculating
its technical and financial metrics over a project's lifetime. The script handles
data preprocessing, turbine efficiency modeling, renewable energy estimation, and
cost-benefit analysis, presenting results through plots and outputs.

Key Features:
-------------
1. Load and preprocess historical flow data.
2. Calculate flow-duration and power-duration curves.
3. Model turbine efficiency and plant performance.
4. Estimate renewable energy available and firm power.
5. Perform financial analysis, including cash flow, NPV, IRR, and payback period.

Inputs:

I have used a randomy generated data for demonstration. The user have to prepare the folliwing inputs:
-------
1. Historical flow data in an Excel file with columns:
    - "Date": Timestamps of flow readings.
    - "Flow (m¬≥/s)": Recorded flow rates.
2. Plant and turbine parameters (e.g., gross head, design flow).
3. Financial parameters (e.g., inflation rate, discount rate).

Outputs:
--------
1. Efficiency, flow, and power data tables.
2. Power-duration and cash-flow plots.
3. Key metrics: NPV, IRR, payback period, and firm power energy.

Equations:
-----------
Flow Duration Curve
================

- A flow duration is produced from historical flow data.
- The flow-duration curve is specified by twenty-one values representing the flow on the flow-duration curve in 5% increments.
- the produced FDC Highlights design flow and firm flow thresholds.

The model currently supports Pelton turbines, but I am planning to add more turbine types in future updates!

**Rotational Speed and Runner Diameter of pelton turbine:**
- Rotational Speed: $$RPM = \frac{31 . H_{rated}. Q_{design} }{ j }$$
- Runner Diameter: $$D =\frac{ 49.4 . H_{rated} .{j}^{0.02} }{ RPM}$$
- $j$= number of jets

*Pelton Turbine Efficiency Calculations:**
- Turbine Peak Efficiency: $$e_p= 0.864 . D^{0.04}$$
- Peak Efficiency Flow: $$Q_p = (0.662 + 0.001 √ó j) . Q_{design}$$
- Efficiency at Specific Flow : $$e_t = e_p (1 - (1.31 + 0.025 j) . |\frac{ Q_p - Q }{ Q_p}|^{5.6 + 0.4 j})
$$


Power and Energy output Calculation
============================
- Actual power P available from the small hydro plant at any given flow value Q is given by the following equation:


$$P = œÅ  .g  .Q_{values}  .H_{net} . e_{t} . e_{g} .(1 - l_{t}) .(1 - l_{para})$$ 

Where:
- $H_{net}$= Net head
- $l_{t}$ = transformer losses
- $l_{para}$= parasitic losses
- $e_{g}$=generator effeciency (user input)
  

- Net head calculation:
$$H_{net} = H_{rated} - H_{loss} - H_{tailwater}$$


**Hydraulic Losses and Tailwater Effects:**

- Hydraulic Loss:

$$
H_{loss} = H_{gross} \cdot 0.03 \cdot \left(\frac{Q_{values}}{Q_{design}}\right)^2
$$

- Tailwater Effect:
$$H_{tailwater} = 0 \quad \text{if } \quad Q \leq Q_{design}$$

$$H_{tailwater}=3 * (\frac{Q - Q_{design}}{ Q_{max} - Q_{design}})^ 2 \quad \text{if } \quad Q> Q_{design}
$$


**Plant Capacity**
- Plant capacity $P_{des}$ is calculated by re-writing the power equation above at the design flow $Q_{des}$.

Power-duration curve
====
- Calculation of power available as a function of flow using the power equation for all 21 values of the available flow that are used to define the flow-duration curve, leads to 21 values of available power defining a power-duration curve.

- Since the design flow is defined as the maximum flow that can be used by the turbine, the value of $Q_{des}$ is employed for flow quantities exceeding the design flow.

   Cost Analysis and Financial Indicators.
====
**Net Present Value (NPV)**

- Net Present Value (NPV) is a method used to evaluate the profitability of a project or investment by summing the present values of all cash flows (inflows and outflows) over the life of the project.

$$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_{t} }{ (1 + r)^t}$$

Where:
- $C_{t}$= cash flow at time t
- $r$ = Discount rate (reflecting the time value of money)
- $t$ = Year (from 0 to n)
- $n$ = Project life (total number of years)






**Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**

- The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate (ùëü) at which the Net Present Value (NPV) of an investment becomes zero. In simpler terms, it is the annualized rate of return that a project or investment is expected to generate.

$$NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_{t} }{ (1 + IRR)^t}=0$$ 




**Payback period**

- The Payback Period is the time it takes for a project to recover its initial investment through its cumulative cash inflows. In other words, it‚Äôs the point where the cumulative cash flow turns positive.


**Year to Positive Cash Flow**

-The Year to Positive Cash Flow is the first year when the cumulative cash flow becomes non-negative. It tells you the earliest point when the project stops losing money and starts generating a net positive return.
